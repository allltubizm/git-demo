[Verse 1]
Hatin' bitches be angry, hatin' bitches, they ain't me
How the fuck I'm still chewin' bitches in gray shorts and a plain tee?
Mad as fuck if I was them, D&G and it's custom
Cuban Link with a pink gem, I'm the one who they pumpin' (Yup)
Rap bitch on a pop chart, toastin' bitches like Pop-Tarts
You's a flop, bitch, knock it off, where the champagne? I'ma pop it off
Bitch, you know you ain't like that, post a pic and he like that
Fat butt with a back tat, and I been bad like Mike Jack (Yup)
Talk a lot, but ain't sayin' shit, I ain't hear your song, they ain't playin' it
Sloppy hoes gon' chat the most, if you make your bed, better lay in it
Name got the bitch gaggin', hit the bench, I been tagged in
Bitch, you lost, throw the flag in, stay on a jet, but ain't laggin' (Yup)
